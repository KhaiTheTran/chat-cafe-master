You are welcome to ChatCafe game!###

Once we had a first level ready and playable, we tested it on 
a pair of classmates from a different class that one of our 
members was attending. We didn't have 15 minutes of gameplay,
but given thatmost of our gameplay would be centered around 
the engine that we were developing, we figured that this 
would be a good time to get advice and iterate on our results.###

The first thing we noticed is that our tutorial was only 
somewhat effective. Currently, we just had a page of 
instructions for the player to read, which didn't tell 
them much about the instructions for each individual 
recipe. However, we did notice that the instructions for
the recipes seemed intuitive enough, as once the players 
started playing the game, they seemed to pick up the recipe 
details quickly. Our goal is to make the next recipes that 
we implement to be similar to this, where each one is 
relatively intuitive within their own right so that even 
if a user doesn't read the instructions, it is relatively 
easy for them to take a split second and understand what 
is going on.

Please, choose the ingridients from the left side of the

                 Have fun!###
